# ECEN215-LK

This is the Flutter code for the mobile app developed as part of the ECEN 215 Lab Kit capstone project. This project was completed by Group 30 in ECEN 403/404 during the Spring '23 and Fall '24 semesters.

To download this application onto a mobile device, you must first set up the Flutter environment on your computer. Refer to this tutorial for guidance on setting up Flutter using VSCode. Once the Flutter environment is set up, download this code, open the project in your terminal, and enter the command flutter create .. Then, connect the mobile device where the application will be installed and enter the command flutter run. After a few minutes, the app should be successfully installed on the mobile device.

Upon opening the app for the first time, the user must enable location services and ensure Bluetooth connectivity on the phone is active. Please refer to the main branch of this repository for instructions on setting up the ECEN 215 Lab Kit with the mobile application.
